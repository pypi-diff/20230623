 ### foambryo
 
 **foambryo** is a python package based on Polyscope designed to infer surface tensions, pressures and stresses from the geometry of epithelial-cell-clusters, namely early-embryos and structures encoutered in stem cell cultures, as organoids and embryoids.
 
 Living structures encountered in the field of developmental biology have intricate shapes and structures, that reflectes their physiological functions. They embody important features: symmetries, polarisations, patterning.
 Mechanics is at the heart of the development of these structures, yet tools to investigate forces at play during development in 3D are scarse. Characterizing and quantifying precisely their shapes allows us to match them to a simple physical model, and to reveal the forces shaping cells.
